## I am an interdisciplinary sustainability researcher drawing from science and technology studies (STS) and feminist theory.

My research interests rest in multispecies relations around biodiversity conservation and natural resource menagement, and how these relate what are seen as to reasonable, just, or transformational sustainable futures. I have experience designing and conducting qualitative and quantitative research using methods including theatre-based workshops, interviews, social media discourse analysis, and participatory mapping surveys. 

I am also an experienced teacher in university-level sustainability courses, lecturing in and developing diverse classes from fields including ecological economics and multidisciplinary human-technology relations. Teaching and research are inextricable in my work, and I am always looking to develop my pedagogical skillset. 

In my future work, I aim to develop my expertise through post-qualitative inquiry to explore how horizons for sustainable futures are constructed in the forestry sector. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher for the [RECONNECT Project](https://reconnect-research.eu), which aims to support biodiversity conservation through socio-ecological connections.
