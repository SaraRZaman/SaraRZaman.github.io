## I am an interdisciplinary sustainability researcher drawing from science and technology studies (STS) and feminist theory.

I have experience designing and conducting qualitative and quantitative research using methods including theatre-based workshops, interviews, social media discourse analysis, and participatory mapping surveys. My research objective is to explore and unsettle assumptions about the roles of humans in making sustainable futures. I am also an experienced teacher in university-level sustainability courses, lecturing in and developing diverse classes from fields including ecological economics and multidisciplinary human-technology relations. In my future work, I aim to develop my expertise through post-qualitative inquiry to explore how horizons for sustainable futures are constructed. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher for the [RECONNECT Project](https://reconnect-research.eu).
