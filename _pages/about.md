## I am an interdisciplinary sustainability researcher drawing from science and technology studies (STS) and feminist theory.

I have experience designing and conducting qualitative and quantitative research using methods including theatre-based workshops, interviews, social media discourse analysis, and participatory mapping surveys. My research interests lie in multispecies and organizational relations, and how these relate what are seen as to reasonable, just, or transformational sustainable futures. I am also an experienced teacher in university-level sustainability courses, lecturing in and developing diverse classes from fields including ecological economics and multidisciplinary human-technology relations. In my future work, I aim to develop my expertise through post-qualitative inquiry to explore how horizons for sustainable futures are constructed in the forestry sector. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher for the [RECONNECT Project](https://reconnect-research.eu), which aims to support biodiversity conservation through socio-ecological connections.
