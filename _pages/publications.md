Zaman, Sara. “Otto Latva: The Giant Squid in Transatlantic Culture. The Monsterization of Molluscs (Book Review).” TRACE∴ Journal for Human-Animal Studies 11 (2024).

> "Through his research, [Latva] claims that with a better understanding of how humans relate with squids and other so-called “monstrous species” (such as
sharks and wolves), we can better understand how to live with these beings for sustainable futures. Latva suggests that some may fear nature that is beyond human control; it may also be necessary to consider how to live with those useless or frightening beings we have labeled as monsters."

> "Our skins are marked by a culture of individualism and self-satisfaction, certain stories that atomize us from ourselves, and one another. While we may not always notice these stories, some people are adept at pointing them out to us."
